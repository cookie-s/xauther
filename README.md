xauther
=======

A Ruby module to do like "xAuth" without grant by Twitter.

DESCRIPTION
===========

This module emulates "xAuth", using "OAuth".

There is a process called "xAuth" on Twitter.
It enables applications to get access tokens by not make clients visit Twitter OAuth page on browser but only having your id & password typed.
But one of the problems is to use "xAuth" requires grant by Twitter.
And the other is it cannot provide the permission to read Direct Messages.
